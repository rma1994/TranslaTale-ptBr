#About the pt-Br:

This version support portuguese accents. It will not show the accents on the preview box. Instead it will replace it by the same character without accent. 
So, if someone type "Ol√°", the preview box will show "Ola".

All the new characters were created by Mex:

The Test Fonts option will open the game after replace the the original fonts by the ones created by Mex. The new fonts allow you the game to show pt-Br accents.
